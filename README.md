# Crop-Recommendation-System-Using-ML
The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based web application that recommends the most suitable crop to grow based on various environmental conditions such as soil type, nutrients, and weather parameters. This project aims to help farmers and agricultural planners make data-driven decisions to improve productivity and land usage.
